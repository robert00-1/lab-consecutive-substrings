    CREATE empty list called substrings

    FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO length of inputString - 1

      SET currentSubstring TO empty string

      FOR endIndex FROM startIndex TO length of inputString - 1

        ADD character at endIndex to currentSubstring
        ADD currentSubstring to substrings list

      END FOR

    END FOR

    RETURN substrings

  END FUNCTION

Solution Description:
This solution generates all consecutive substrings from a given string.
The string is treated like an array of characters. The algorithm uses
two loops: the outer loop selects a starting position, and the inner loop
builds substrings by adding one character at a time moving to the right.
Each newly formed substring is stored in a result array.

How It Works:
1. Initialize an empty array to store substrings.
2. Loop through the string using an index as the starting point.
3. For each starting point, create substrings by extending one character
   at a time to the right.
4. Add each substring to the result array.
5. Return the array containing all consecutive substrings.

Time Complexity:
O(n²), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the solution uses two nested loops that both depend on
the size of the input.

Space Complexity:
O(n²), since all possible substrings are stored in memory.
